# PacMen Factory
## Description of project
This is a project that creates PacMen and they are moving in the whole of the webpage. They are moving into the corners of the webpage and when they hit one of the corners they change direction, so that no PacMan gets out of the webpage corners.
## How to Run
If you want to run this project you can just open the direct GitHub Pages link https://nikolaosnikolov.github.io/pacmen-factory/ on your web browser. Then, if you click the button that adds PacMen, new PacMen are getting into your page. If you click the second button that makes the PacMen moved, all the PacMen are starting moving inside the page together. If you first click the button of movement and then the button that adds new PacMen there is no problem. The results is going to be new PacMen that are moving in the page.
## Roadmap of future improvements
For this projects there was a specific thing to do, so this one has been done. What I mean is that the project was to make PacMen move and that got real. So, I would improve something in the future if I had a better idea.
